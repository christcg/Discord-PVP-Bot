# Discord-PVP-Bot
PVP bot created for a chat based roleplay group on Discord. 
Is connected to a database that keeps track of roleplayers, their charactes and any information related to the PVP.

## Updates
* Succesfully created bot; added first command.

## Tasks
* Hook up to SQL database (which one?)
* Implement database functions (Add characters, users,abilities)
* Abilities
** Restrict to user based on discord ID or tag #
** Implement ability statistics
* Add Session statistic trackers (starts from base stat stored in database)

##Notes
PVP is only one session at a time; every session has to be used by a moderator (reina has to be there to run the pvp sessions) due to fact that bot won't be stored on server.
